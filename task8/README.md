# Task 8: Getting started with Magenta.js by Google 

## Learning objective: 
By the end of Task 8, you will be able to understand how to use magenta.js and add it to your web app

## Script: 
Welcome back. We are now getting closer to our goal of using AI to generate melodies. Isn’t that great? A great tool to use for this is Magenta. So by the end of this task,  you will be able to add magenta to your web apps. 
And the process for this is very simple. The first thing that I want you to do, it’s to open a new tab [... go to magenta copy script, explain, magenta and checkpoint add model and check point]
Go to script.js add checkpoint then go to https://magenta.github.io/magenta-js/music/classes/_music_rnn_model_.musicrnn.html check constructurtor and initialize the model
Good bye.

## Quiz Questions:

What is a pre trained checkpoint in magenta.jsl?
1. Weights from a model trained with the Python-based Magenta models
2. The script to add our specific model to our app
3. Weights from a model trained in the browser
4. Weights from a model that you need to train on your own environment

Do we need to bring TensorFlow.js for the magenta model?
1. True
2. Falses
