# Task 1: Getting Started with Glitch

## Learning objective: 
By the end of Task 1, you will be able to create a starting template for your web app using Glitch.

## Script: 
Welcome to this guided project about how to Create a web app that generates melodies using Magenta’s AI”. My name is Juan Carlos, and I will be your instructor for this project. I am a musician and a machine learning practitioner interested in the intersection of AI and creativity, so I am extremely excited to teach this project. This project is for people who are interested in music and machine learning. I’ll teach you how to use a Magenta.js in a web application,. Magenta.js is a library of AI created by Google, to continue melodies based on given seed notes. You don’t need to be an expert in web development or machine learning to take this project, but you should be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some basic music knowledge would also help you to understand the concepts, especially, it would be better if you are somehow familiar with western music notation.

I’m excited to teach you how to create a web app that let’s the users add a musical idea in a staff and then Magenta is going to take this musical idea as the seed notes of a melody. For this, besides Magenta, we are going to use Vexflow (to create the staff) and Tone.js (so users can hear the seed notes)
 
Let’s take a look at what you’ll accomplish by the end of this project. 
 
{Demo: show demos of users inserting notes in the staff so Magenta generates a melody using those notes as the starting notes of the melody} 

Using Magenta, we have different options to use artificial intelligence for creativity. Throughout each Task in this project, I will show you how to integrate all the elements of this app.
 
First, let’s take a quick look of the environment we are going to use [about Rhyme]
 
Alright, let’s dive right in. Please go in your browser to glitch.com/edit … [brief explanation of Glitch]

Now let’s practice! Pause your video to try some of the feature of glitch and read the Readme file.

Great job on completing the first part of this project! In this Task, we learned about how to create a starting template for your web app using Glitch.
 
In the next Task, we’ll pick up where we left off here and we will create a simple form so that users can add the seed notes of the melody the AI will generate.
